# Converting regexes to NFA, epsilon-NFA, DFA

(from AI)

Converting a regular expression to a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) involves breaking down the expression into smaller parts and building the NFA incrementally. 
This process often utilizes Thompson's construction as a method. The resulting NFA can then be converted to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) if needed. 

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Understanding the Building Blocks:

   * Regular Expressions: These are patterns used to describe sets of strings.
   * NFA: A type of finite automaton that allows for multiple transitions from a state on the same input symbol, or epsilon (empty string) transitions. 
   * Epsilon NFA (ε-NFA): A type of NFA that allows transitions on the empty string (ε).

2. Thompson's Construction (for Epsilon NFAs):

   This method builds the NFA from the regular expression by applying specific rules for each operator and character in the expression. 

   * For a single character (e.g., 'a'):
     + Create two states, one initial and one final, with a transition between them labeled 'a'.

   * For the union operator `( | )`:
     + Create a new initial state and connect it with epsilon transitions to the initial states of the NFAs for the expressions being combined.
     + Create a new final state and connect it with epsilon transitions to the final states of the combined NFAs.

   * For the concatenation operator:
     + Connect the final state of the first NFA to the initial state of the second NFA with an epsilon transition.

   * For the Kleene star operator `():*`
     + Add epsilon transitions from the initial state to the final state and from the final state to the initial state.
      
4. Epsilon NFA to NFA Conversion:

   Once you have the ε-NFA, you'll need to convert it to a standard NFA without epsilon transitions. 
   This involves finding the epsilon closure of each state and adjusting the transitions accordingly.
  
   * Epsilon Closure:
    
     The set of states reachable from a given state by following only epsilon transitions.
    
   * Adjust Transitions:
    
     + For each state in the original NFA, find the epsilon closure.
     + Then, for each symbol in the alphabet, create a transition from the original state to a new state if there is a transition from the epsilon closure of the original state to that new state on that symbol.
      
5. Example:

   Let's say the regular expression is `(a|b)*abb`.

   * Start by creating NFAs for 'a', 'b', and 'ab' individually.
   * Combine 'a' and 'b' using the union operator, creating an ε-NFA for (a|b).
   * Add a Kleene star to create `(a|b)*`.
   * Concatenate `(a|b)*` with 'a', then with 'b', and finally with another 'b' to get the complete ε-NFA for `(a|b)*abb`.
   * Convert the ε-NFA to a standard NFA without epsilon transitions.
